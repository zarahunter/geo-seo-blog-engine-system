"""Load a project-root context file (BRAND.md, VOICE.md, or DISCOURSE.md)
and emit a fenced untrusted-data block with a fresh cryptographic nonce.

This is the code-enforced layer of the Untrusted-Data Contract documented
in `skills/blog/SKILL.md`. The orchestrator instructs Claude to invoke
this helper for every project-root file load; the helper:

1. Validates the path (refuses symlinks via O_NOFOLLOW, refuses non-regular
   files, enforces a size cap).
2. Generates a fresh 128-bit hex nonce via `secrets.token_hex(16)` (a
   cryptographically-strong PRNG; NOT the LLM's own token output).
3. Wraps the file contents in BEGIN/END fence markers tagged with the
   nonce. An attacker who controls the file contents cannot pre-embed a
   matching terminator because they cannot predict the nonce.
4. Runs the sanitization scan; prepends a warning to the fence if
   instruction-shaped patterns are detected.
5. Includes file mtime as provenance.
6. Prints the fenced block to stdout for the orchestrator to inject into
   the downstream agent's system prompt.

The nonce defense is now CODE-ENFORCED via this helper (when the orchestrator
follows its instruction to use it). Three other layers remain in the
contract: sanitize (also performed here), tool-boundary (platform-enforced
via agent frontmatter), and provenance (also emitted here).

Usage:
    python3 scripts/load_untrusted_root.py <path-to-file>

    Output: a fenced block ready for injection into a system prompt.

Exits non-zero on validation failure (with a stderr message safe to log).
